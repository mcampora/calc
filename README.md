Simple example of boolean expressions evaluation written in C++ using Bison.
I compiled this program on Win7 using Cygwin and a separate download of Bison.

> make                    % to build the example

> calc++ examples.txt     % to run the example and evaluate the content of a file

Supports:
- variables (usage of predefined strings)
- function calls (used of predefined functions accepting one integer parameter)
- boolean operators with integer expressions
- boolean operators with string literals or variables
